# COBOL Test Suite Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive COBOL test programs designed to validate the behavior of the original COBOL account management system before conversion to Python. These tests serve as functional specifications and validation benchmarks to ensure 100% compatibility between the legacy COBOL system and the modernized Python implementation.

### 3. test-data-manager.cob

**Purpose**: Validates data storage and retrieval operations

**Test Coverage**:

- Data read operations from working storage
- Data write operations to working storage
- Data integrity verification
- Zero balance handling

**Test Cases**:

1. Data Read Test - Verifies successful data retrieval
2. Data Write Test - Verifies successful data storage
3. Zero Balance Write Test - Verifies handling of zero values
4. Data Integrity Test - Verifies read-after-write consistency

**Expected Results**: 4/4 tests should pass, demonstrating complete data management functionality

## Test Execution Instructions

### Prerequisites

- COBOL compiler (GnuCOBOL, Micro Focus COBOL, or IBM COBOL)
- Access to COBOL runtime environment

### Compilation Commands

```bash
# Using GnuCOBOL (open source)
cobc -x test-main-program.cob -o test-main-program
cobc -x test-operations.cob -o test-operations
cobc -x test-data-manager.cob -o test-data-manager

# Using Micro Focus COBOL
cob test-main-program.cob
cob test-operations.cob
cob test-data-manager.cob
```

### Execution Commands

```bash
# Run individual test programs
./test-main-program
./test-operations
./test-data-manager

# Or on Windows
test-main-program.exe
test-operations.exe
test-data-manager.exe
```

## Test Results Interpretation

### Success Criteria

Each test program displays:

- Individual test case results (PASS/FAIL)
- Test execution details and expected vs actual values
- Summary statistics (Total/Passed/Failed counts)
- Overall test suite result

### Expected Output Format

```
=========================================
COBOL [TEST SUITE NAME] TEST SUITE
=========================================
Test: [Test Description]
Operation: [Operation Type]
Expected: [Expected Behavior]
Result: PASS - [Success Message]
...
=========================================
COBOL [TEST SUITE NAME] TEST SUMMARY
=========================================
Total Tests Run:    [N]
Tests Passed:       [N]
Tests Failed:       [0]
Overall Result:     ALL TESTS PASSED
=========================================
```

## Validation Against Python Implementation

### Functional Parity Verification

1. **Menu System**: COBOL test results validate that Python implementation preserves:

   - Menu display format and options
   - Input validation and error handling
   - Program flow and navigation logic

2. **Account Operations**: COBOL test results validate that Python implementation preserves:

   - Balance viewing functionality
   - Credit operation logic and validation
   - Debit operation logic and insufficient funds checking
   - Amount validation and error handling

3. **Data Management**: COBOL test results validate that Python implementation preserves:
   - Data persistence between operations
   - Read/write operation consistency
   - Zero balance handling and storage

### Conversion Validation Process

1. Execute COBOL test suite and document results
2. Execute Python test suite with identical test scenarios
3. Compare results to verify functional equivalence
4. Document any discrepancies and resolution approaches
5. Confirm 100% compatibility before production deployment

## Business Logic Preservation

### Account Management Rules

The COBOL tests validate these business rules that must be preserved:

- Account balance cannot go below zero (overdraft protection)
- Credit amounts must be positive values
- Debit amounts must be positive values and not exceed balance
- All monetary values maintain appropriate decimal precision
- Menu choices must be within valid range (1-4)
- Invalid inputs are rejected with appropriate error messages

### Data Integrity Requirements

The COBOL tests validate these data integrity rules:

- Balance values persist between program executions
- Read operations return exact values previously written
- Monetary calculations maintain precision without rounding errors
- Zero balance is handled as a valid state

## Integration with Python Testing

### Test Case Mapping

Each COBOL test case has a corresponding Python test case:

**COBOL Test** → **Python Test**

- Menu display → `test_menu_display()`
- Valid choices → `test_valid_menu_choices()`
- Invalid choices → `test_invalid_menu_choice()`
- Credit operations → `test_credit_amount()`
- Debit operations → `test_debit_amount()`
- Insufficient funds → `test_debit_insufficient_funds()`
- Data persistence → `test_data_persistence()`

### Automated Validation

The Python test suite includes comparison tests that:

1. Execute the same business logic as COBOL tests
2. Verify identical results and behavior
3. Validate error handling and edge cases
4. Confirm data integrity and persistence

## Conclusion

The COBOL test suite provides comprehensive validation of the original system behavior, serving as the definitive specification for the Python conversion. By achieving 100% pass rates in both COBOL and Python test suites, we demonstrate complete functional equivalence and successful modernization without loss of business functionality.

This testing approach ensures:

- **Zero functionality loss** during conversion
- **Complete business rule preservation** in the new system
- **Reliable validation benchmark** for future modifications
- **Documentation of original system behavior** for maintenance and enhancement
